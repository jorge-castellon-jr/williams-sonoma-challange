# PAGES

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.

The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

Any folders created in this directory become paths for new views.

```
i.e. pages/product/\_id.vue become \<base url\>/product/\<product id\>
```

Folder Structure:

- product/
  - \_slug.vue
- index.vue

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).
